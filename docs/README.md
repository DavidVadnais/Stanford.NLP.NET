### Versioning

Versioning model used for NuGet packages is aligned to versioning used by Stanford NLP Group. For example, if you get Stanford CoreNLP distribution from [Stanford NLP site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml) with version `3.9.1`, then the NuGet version of this package has a version `3.9.1.x`, where `x` is the greatest that is available on NuGet. Last number is used for internal versioning of .NET assemblies.
