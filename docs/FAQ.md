# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it work? Where is C# source code for Stanford.NLP.NET?

`Stanford.NLP.NET` is built on top of [IKVM.NET](http://weblog.ikvm.net/) (`Java` VM that runs on top of `.NET` VM). There is no `C#` source code and no efforts for `Java->C#` code translation. This project uses [IKVM.NET Bytecode Compiler](http://www.ikvm.net/userguide/ikvmc.html) that converts `Java` bytecode (`*.jar`) to `.NET` (`*.dll`).

### I heard that IKVM.NET is dead, what will be with this project?

Yes, there is an official announcement of [The End of IKVM.NET](http://weblog.ikvm.net/2017/04/21/TheEndOfIKVMNET.aspx), but it does not mean the end of `Stanford.NLP.NET`. Current stable version of `IKVM.NET` has perfect support of `Java 8` and we have a confirmation from `Stanford NLP` group that `CoreNLP` will remain `Java 8` compatible for foreseeable future.

### What NuGet package should I reference and use?

It really depends on your task, you always should try to choose one (referencing of more than one package is a not supported scenario). If your task is rather complicated or you do not know which one to choose - use [Stanford.NLP.CoreNLP](samples/CoreNLP.html). This is an umbrella package that integrates all Stanford tools.

### Stanford.NLP.CoreNLP not loading models

This is probably [the most common problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40814503/stanford-nlp-for-net-not-loading-models) with `CoreNLP` (especially for newcomers). `stanfrod-corenlp-ful-*.zip` archive contains files `stanford-corenlp-3.9.1-models.jar` with models inside (this is a zip archive). In Java world, you add this `jar` on the class path, and it automatically resolves models' location in the archive.

CoreNLP has a file [DefaultPaths.java](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP/blob/ef653d4f64f82b0395f72d43cc7add8e61752fee/src/edu/stanford/nlp/pipeline/DefaultPaths.java) that specifies path to model file. So when you instantiate `StanfordCoreNLP` with `Properties` object that does not specify models' location, you should guarantee that models could be found by default path (related to `Environment.CurrentDirectory`).

The simplest way to guarantee existence of files at path like `Environment.CurrentDirectory + "edu/stanford/nlp/models/ner/english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser.gz"` is to unzip a jar archive to the folder, and temporary change the current directory to the unzipped folder.

```csharp
var jarRoot = "nlp.stanford.edu/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31/jar-modules/";
...
var curDir = Environment.CurrentDirectory;
Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(jarRoot);
var pipeline = new StanfordCoreNLP(props);
Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(curDir);
```

The other way is to specify paths to all models that your pipeline needs (it actually depends on the list of `annotators`).
This option is more complicated because you have to find correct property keys, and specify paths to all used model. But it may be useful if you want to minimize the size of your deployment package.

```csharp
var props = new Properties();
props.put("annotators", "tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, ner, depparse");
props.put("ner.model",
          "edu/stanford/nlp/models/ner/english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser.gz");
props.put("ner.applyNumericClassifiers", "false");
var pipeline = new StanfordCoreNLP(props);
```

### StackOverflow Exception

You probably try to execute code under `IIS Express`. So you have two options here: [deploy to IIS](https://github.com/sergey-tihon/Stanford.NLP.NET/issues/15#issuecomment-77526331) or [run under 64bit version of IIS Express](https://github.com/sergey-tihon/Stanford.NLP.NET/issues/43#issuecomment-190186401). In VS2015 it is under `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > Web Projects > Use the 64 bit version of IIS Express` for web sites and projects.
