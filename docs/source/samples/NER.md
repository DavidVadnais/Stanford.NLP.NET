>**Stanford NER** is an implementation of a `Named Entity Recognizer`. Named Entity Recognition (`NER`) labels sequences of words in a text which are the names of things, such as person and company names, or gene and protein names. It comes with well-engineered feature extractors for Named Entity Recognition, and many options for defining feature extractors. Included with the download are good named entity recognizers for English, particularly for the 3 classes (`PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LOCATION`), and Stanford NLP Group also makes available on [the original page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html) various other models for different languages and circumstances, including models trained on just the [CoNLL 2003](http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2003/ner/) English training data. The distributional similarity features in some models improve performance but the models require considerably more memory.
>
>Stanford NER is also known as `CRFClassifier`. The software provides a general implementation of (arbitrary order) linear chain `Conditional Random Field` (`CRF`) sequence models. That is, by training your own models, you can actually use this code to build sequence models for any task.

>You can look at a PowerPoint Introduction to NER and the Stanford NER package [ppt](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/jenny-ner-2007.ppt) [pdf](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/jenny-ner-2007.pdf) or the [FAQ](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/crf-faq.shtml), which has some information on training models. Further documentation is provided in the included README and in the javadocs.
